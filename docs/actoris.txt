SLIDE 1 — Economic OS for AI Agents
⏱ 60 sec
"HUMAIN ONE is an agentic platform. Agents execute, orchestrate, deliver. But here's what no platform has solved yet — the economy underneath.
1.8 billion actions per day across enterprise AI. Who pays? Who verifies value was actually created? Who decides which agent earns more compute tomorrow?
Today's stack everywhere: Models — built. Orchestration — built. Infrastructure — built. Economic layer — nothing.
Actoris is that layer.
We instrument agent work. We prove outcomes in under 2 seconds. We price every action based on compute, risk, and trust. We allocate capital to the agents that perform — and cull the ones that don't.
Identity. Proof. Pricing. Allocation. Capital.
We turn agent activity into a measurable, auditable, financeable economy. That's what we bring to HUMAIN ONE."
SLIDE 2 — The Problem: Agents Work, Their Economy Is Not Accounted
⏱ 60 sec
"3,699 actions per second flowing through enterprise AI. But what's the ROI? What's the GDP? Nobody knows.
Four gaps kill you:
No Identity — human, agent, organization can't link. No lineage. No accountability.
No Ledger — there's no sub-2-second proof of outcome. Verification takes days. Your finance team is flying blind.
No Pricing — you're paying for seats and API calls, not value delivered. A high-performing agent costs the same as a useless one.
No Metric — there's no AGDP. You cannot stand in front of a board and say: 'Our agents generated $X of economic value this year.'
And if you can't measure it, you can't build credit, insurance, or capital markets on top of it."

SLIDE 3 — Fragmented Compute, GDP Leakage
⏱ 45 sec
"Here's what the absence of an economic layer actually costs:
Compute sits idle 30 to 48 percent of the time. Identity is fragmented — agents can't price risk or receive credit. Billing is opaque — flat licensing hides true ROI. Disputes hit 2 to 5 percent with 24+ hour resolution.
What changes with Actoris:
Gross margin improves 8 to 12 points. Net revenue retention up 5 to 10 points. Days sales outstanding drops 15 to 30 days. Disputes fall under 0.8 percent.
Without this layer, agents remain expensive toys. Not scalable economic actors."

SLIDE 4 — System Overview: Actoris in One Slide
⏱ 60 sec
"Four engines working as one system.
IdentityCloud — a UnifiedID for every human, agent, and organization. Who acts, who pays, who underwrites — all linked in one graph.
TrustLedger — 3-of-N oracle consensus that produces immutable outcome records in under 2 seconds. CFO and auditor grade.
OneBill — outcome-based pricing per verified action. Not seats. Not API calls. You pay for value, invoiced per client, per domain, per agent cluster.
Darwinian — a normalized compute currency called HC, measured in PFLOP-hours. The engine automatically reallocates compute to highest-return agents. Underperformers get culled.
One system that turns an agent fleet into an auditable, priced, optimized economy — not just a pile of workflows."
________________


SLIDE 5 — IdentityCloud
⏱ 45 sec
"Every entity — human, agent, or organization — gets a UnifiedID.
Attached to that ID: a TrustScore from 0 to 1000, updated dynamically based on verified behavior. And an HC Wallet — compute credit denominated in PFLOP-hours.
Targets: 3,000 to 5,000 IDs in the first 30 days. 10,000 by day 90. Identity verification SLO: 99.3 percent pass rate.
Revenue model: $7.50 base per entity plus $0.024 per action. Projected monthly revenue at day 90: $84,600.
This is the foundation. Without identity, you can't have trust. Without trust, you can't have an economy."

SLIDE 6 — TrustLedger
⏱ 45 sec
"Every action flows through 3-of-N oracle consensus. Quorum reached — it becomes an immutable record. Hash, timestamp, verified outcome.
Benchmarks:
Verification latency: under 2 seconds. Today's manual approval process takes 24 hours.
Quality pass rate: 99.2 percent — only verified outcomes hit the ledger.
Dispute rate: under 0.8 percent. Industry standard is 5 percent.
TrustLedger transforms agent actions into auditable, billable, trust-building economic primitives. Finance teams get real-time visibility into AI spending and ROI."
________________


SLIDE 7 — OneBill: Programmable Billing
⏱ 45 sec
"The formula: price equals compute plus risk minus trust.
Example: Base cost 8 cents. Risk premium adds 4 cents based on agent behavior and task complexity. Trust discount subtracts 1.8 cents for agents with proven track records.
Final price: 10.2 cents per action.
High-trust agents pay less. Low-trust agents pay more — or get culled entirely.
No seat licenses. No manual approvals. Automatic settlement based on verified TrustScore.
Impact: maximum 20 percent discount for trusted agents. Cost per action down 3 to 5 percent. Margin up 2 to 3 percentage points."
________________


SLIDE 8 — Protocol DNA
⏱ 45 sec
"Four native primitives that create compounding network effects.
Spawn — parent agents can create children. Trust inheritance capped at 30 percent. No free trust transfer.
Lend — risk-priced credit based on TrustScore. Current APR: 3.2 percent.
Insure — outcome guarantees. If a verified task fails, insurance covers the loss.
Delegate — escrow plus verification for buyer-supplier transactions.
These primitives are programmable, cross-reinforcing, and non-replicable — because they're built on proprietary trust data that only exists inside the network.
First-mover advantage compounds daily."

SLIDE 9 — How Actoris Wraps an Existing Stack
⏱ 45 sec
"Integration is non-intrusive. Actoris wraps your existing agent runtime — no rip-and-replace.
Your stack — whether it's HUMAIN ONE, LangGraph, or custom — keeps emitting action candidates.
Actoris Rail intercepts and runs four steps:
IdentityCloud binds every action to a UnifiedID.
Oracle Cluster verifies with 3-of-N consensus.
OneBill prices and settles — example: $0.004 per verified action.
Darwinian calculates return index and reallocates compute.
Outputs feed into dashboards for billing, finance, and risk. Your infrastructure stays intact. We add the economic layer on top."

SLIDE 10 — The Darwinian Engine
⏱ 45 sec
"Every hour, compute capacity shifts to agents creating the most verified value.
Winners — agents with high return index — get more resources. Laggards get culled.
This is automated ROI optimization at the compute layer.
CFO outcomes:
Efficiency up 20 percent. Cost savings of 13 percent. Margin improvement of 3 percentage points. Net revenue retention impact of plus 10 points.
The best agents survive. The rest don't."

SLIDE 11 — What the Economic Rail Changes
⏱ 60 sec
"Two phases.
Pilot phase — 1 to 2 domains over 90 days:
AGDP instrumented: $0.5 to $2 billion per year in verified agent outcomes now visible for the first time.
Revenue recapture: 1.5 to 4.5 percent — translates to $7.5 to $90 million per year.
Compute efficiency gains: 10 to 30 percent — $40 to $120 million saved.
Disputes reduced from 3-5 percent to under 0.8 percent.
DSO improved by 5 to 12 days — $20 to $80 million in working capital freed.
Scale phase — multi-domain over 24 months:
AGDP: $5 to $50 billion per year. Net margin expansion: 3 to 8 points. AGDP-linked capital: $1 to $10 billion in financing unlocked through verified outcome streams."

SLIDE 12 — The Agent Economy Map
⏱ 45 sec
"Three layers of the agent economy.
Production — what agents produce. AGDP equals sum of actions times price. Disputes under 0.8 percent. DSO down 15 to 30 days. Gross margin around 90 percent.
Transactions — how money moves. Verify, settle, split. Dynamic take rate. Tight cash cycle. Auditable revenue.
Risk Markets — identity and derivatives. TrustScore 0 to 1000. Insurance premiums at 8 to 12 percent. Credit APR spread of 2 to 4 percent. No data resale — privacy by design.
Net revenue retention above 130 percent. Multi-year lock-in. This is the full economic stack."

SLIDE 13 — Global Trust Grid
⏱ 45 sec
"Multi-enterprise network with federated trust.
Federated IdentityCloud — TrustScores cross tenant boundaries. Behavior tracking works across organizations.
Federated TrustLedger — 3-of-N consensus with mixed quorum. Your oracles, partner oracles, neutral third parties.
Privacy guarantees built in — federated learning, differential privacy on deltas, k-anonymity.
Value distribution follows winner-take-most dynamics: Platform 20 percent, Supplier 60 percent, Buyer 20 percent.
Each tenant that joins improves trust calibration for everyone. Network effects compound. First mover wins."

SLIDE 14 — Darwinian Thermostat + Partnership Fit
⏱ 60 sec
"Agent fitness formula: η equals τ times revenue over cost, where τ is TrustScore divided by 1000.
PID regulator targets 1.05 efficiency ratio. Agents below 0.7 fitness for two epochs get culled. High-return agents get prioritized.
Controls: HC expires after 30 days. Anti-Sybil protection via stake plus heuristics. Collusion detection on ledger. Full audit trail — ID, hash, timestamp.
Why this fits HUMAIN:
HUMAIN has the reactor — sovereign IDs, full-stack from energy to models, ambition to be an AI civilization node.
Actoris adds the economic grid — UnifiedID across the stack, TrustLedger for government and enterprise verticals, OneBill per verified outcome, HC as compute-native currency.
Together: the first sovereign AGDP grid."

SLIDE 15 — Vision: HUMAIN as the First Sovereign AGDP Grid
⏱ 60 sec
"HUMAIN has the foundation — full-stack energy plus compute, agentic OS, sovereign cloud and hardware.
The missing layer is economic instrumentation — identity, proof of outcome, billing per action, AGDP metrics, HC as programmable money.
Actoris delivers three things:
A language to talk AI economy to regulators — AGDP gives policymakers something concrete to measure and govern.
A rail to bill and finance that economy — every action priced, verified, settled.
A sovereign export template — this model works for the Gulf, for MENA, for any region building AI sovereignty.
HUMAIN becomes the first sovereign AGDP grid. Not just an AI company. An AI economy.
That's the vision. Happy to take questions."
